## Introduction

Insight reports are interactive reports that you can create to present data to users in your own way.

Insights can be categorised into the following types:

* **General insight reports**
  > These are shown in the reports menu and are not necessarily focussed around a single service, e.g. like a general audit report.
* **Service level insights**
  > These are shown in the reports section of a specific menu item such as curves and show insight information about all items in a specific service.
* **Item level insights**
  > These are shown in an insights menu after selecting a specific item and provide information about the selected item.
  > 
  > See [Creating Item Insights](/docs/odsl/insights/item/create)
* **Excel insights**
  > These are available in the insights section of the Excel add-in and return the data into your Excel worksheet.
