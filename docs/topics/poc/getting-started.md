## Onboarding
### Log into the portal
This first stage of getting started is to log into the portal using your corporate identity (Microsoft Active Directory Login Credentials)

<a className="btn btn-primary" href="https://portal.opendatadsl.com">Portal - Click Sign In</a>

After signing in, you will need to accept the terms of the application.

### Company Details
After signing in, you will be asked a few details about your company. This is only needed to be done once, and can be edited later in the portal 

### Personal Details
You then need to give us a bit of information about yourself. Any other users from your company that sign in will also need to do this.
This information can also be edited later in the portal.

## User Interfaces

### Web Portal

The web portal is a user-friendly web interface to the OpenDataDSL platform which can also be accessed from any mobile device.

### VS Code Extension

The VSCode extension allows you to write, debug and execute code in our 4GL language - [ODSL](/docs/odsl).
It also allows you to upload scripts and report formats to the OpenDataDSL platform to use in processes, reports and SMART data.
