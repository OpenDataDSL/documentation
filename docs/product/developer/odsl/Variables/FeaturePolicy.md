A feature policy variable contains information about which features in the Web Portal that users can see

## Introduction

Feature Policy variables are used to restrict access to certain features within the platform, thereby focussing users on the tasks they need to perform.

## Defining a Feature Policy

Below is a table with all the properties of a feature policy:

|**Name**|**Type**|**Example**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|-|
|_id|String|RunAllReports|The unique id for this policy|
|category|String|TeamUsers|An optional category used for filtering policies|
|description|String|My test policy|A descriptive name for the policy|
|enabled|Boolean|true|True if it is enabled, false to disable it, by default the policy is enabled|
|deny|Boolean|false|By default, all features are available to everyone, so you need to set this to false to deny access to features|
|members|List|user@company.com|The user emails or Azure Active Directory group id's this policy applies to|
|features|List|\["scripts"\]|The list of features that this policy applies to|

## Methods

A policy has the following methods:

|**Name**|**Description**|**Return Type**|
|-|-|-|
|addMember(name)|Adds a member to this policy|void|
|removeMember(name)|Removes a member from this policy|void|

Example policy definition:
```json
{
  "_id": "HideScripts",
  "category": "TradingTeam",
  "description": "Hide Scripts menu item from users",
  "deny": true,
  "members": [
    "user@company.com"
  ],
  "features": [
    "scripts"
  ],
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Portal Feature Names

|**Name**|**Portal Item**|
|-|-|
|masterData|Master Data|
|data|Data|
|events|Events|
|smartData|Smart Data|
|geoData|GEO Data|

## Updating, Finding and Deleting Feature Policies

### Saving a feature policy

To save a feature policy in OpenDataDSL code, use the save command as follows:
```js
HideScripts = FeaturePolicy()
HideScripts.description = "Hide Scripts menu item from users"
HideScripts.features = ["scripts"]
HideScripts.addMember("39c6cccd-d6ea-4ac1-b564-8e4d1e28d75d")
HideScripts.deny = true
HideScripts.enabled = true
save HideScripts
```

### Listing feature policies

To find feature policies, you use the ODSL find command, e.g.
```js
policies = find ${policy} where _type="FeaturePolicy"
```
You can use the unique keyword to just get all the ids of your policies, e.g.
```js
find unique _id from ${policy} where _type="FeaturePolicy"
```

### Retrieving a specific feature policy

To get a specific named feature policy, you use the policy active variable. 
You can then examine the information on the policy, e.g.
```js
p = ${policy:"HideScripts"}
print p.description
```

### Disabling a feature policy
You can disable a feature policy by setting the enabled flag to false, e.g.
```js
p = ${policy:"HideScripts"}
p.enabled = false
save p
```


### Deleting a feature policy

To delete a feature policy, you issue the delete command, e.g.
```js
delete ${policy:"HideScripts"}
```
