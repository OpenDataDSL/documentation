Converts an angle measured in radians to an approximately equivalent angle measured in degrees. The conversion from radians to degrees is generally inexact; users should not expect cos(toRadians(90.0)) to exactly equal 0.0.

Works with:
* Scalars
* Timeseries
* Curves
* Lists/Arrays

#### Syntax
```js
toDegrees(var)
```
