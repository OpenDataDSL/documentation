Returns the arc sine of a value; the returned angle is in the range -pi/2 through pi/2. 

**Special cases:**
* If the argument is NaN or its absolute value is greater than 1, then the result is NaN.
* If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument.

Works with:
* Scalars
* Timeseries
* Curves
* Lists/Arrays
