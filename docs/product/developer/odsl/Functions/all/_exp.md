Returns Euler's number e raised to the power of a double value. 

**Special cases:**
* If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
* If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive infinity.
* If the argument is negative infinity, then the result is positive zero.

The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result. Results must be semi-monotonic.

Works with:
* Scalars
* Timeseries
* Curves
* Lists/Arrays
