Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle. 

**Special cases:**
* If the argument is NaN or an infinity, then the result is NaN.
* If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument.

The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result. Results must be semi-monotonic.

Works with:
* Scalars
* Timeseries
* Curves
* Lists/Arrays

#### Syntax
```js
tan(var)
