## Extension REST API

It is accessed through the following URL:

#### Resource scripts
There are 3 optional special scripts which can be defined:

* **install** - This script will be run when an extension is installed into a client environment after all the defined resources have been copied
* **upgrade** - This script will be run when a new version of an extension is available and upgrades an already installed extension in a client environment
* **uninstall** - This script will be run after an extension is uninstalled and all the defined resources have been removed

The special resource scripts are defined as follows:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "script": {
      "install" : "odsl.example.install",
      "upgrade" : "odsl.example.upgrade",
      "uninstall" : "odsl.example.uninstall"
    }
  }
}
```
