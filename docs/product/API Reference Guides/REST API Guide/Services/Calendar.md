## Calendar REST API

The Calendar REST API is a full CRUD API allowing you to search and filter [calendars](/docs/odsl/calendar/calendars) as well as update, version and delete them. It is accessed through the following URL:
```js
https://api.opendatadsl.com/api/calendar
```
The API consists of the following calls:

|**Method**|**Path**|**Example**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|-|
|GET|||Get the build information for this service|
|GET|\{release\}/\{source\}|'v1/public' 'v1/private'|List public or private calendars|
|GET|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}|v1/private/TEST|Retrieve a single calendar using it’s unique id|
|GET|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}/\{version\}|v1/private/TEST/1|Retrieve a version of a single calendar|
|GET|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}/*|v1/private/TEST/*|Get a list of versions for a specific calendar|
|PUT|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}/\{version\}/\{tag\}|v1/private/TEST/1/PROD|Tag a version with a name (which can be used instead of the version number when retrieving it)|
|POST|\{release\}|v1|Create or update an calendar, the calendar is the body of the POST request|
|DELETE|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}|v1/private/TEST|Rollback to the previous version of a calendar, if it is the only version then the calendar will be deleted|
|DELETE|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}/\{version\}|v1/private/TEST/1|Delete a specific version of a calendar|
|DELETE|\{release\}/\{source\}/\{key\}/*|v1/private/TEST/*|Fully delete a calendar, including all versions|

## Functions

Functions are run with the `_function` query parameter on a GET request:

|**Function**|**Example**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|
|holidays|v1/private/TEST?_function=holidays&year=2026,2027|The holidays of a holiday calendar for the years given (comma separated, default this year): a list of date and name|
|indexes|v1/private/TEST?_function=indexes&start=2026-01-01&end=2026-12-31|The dates of a calendar between start and end (default this calendar year)|
|holiday-report|v1/private?_function=holiday-report&_id=TEST,TEST2&start=2026-01-01&end=2026-12-31|The holidays of several holiday calendars between start and end (default today), sorted by date: a `data` list of `_id`, `date` and `name`|
|index-report|v1/private?_function=index-report&_id=TEST,TEST2&start=2026-01-01&end=2026-01-31|The dates of several calendars between start and end (default today), sorted by date: a `data` list of `_id` and `date`|

Calendars are read from public when the id starts with `#`, otherwise from private.

:::tip
When you create a holiday calendar (`_type` HolidayCalendar), you can give its `rules` as a list of rule strings in ODSL syntax, and they are parsed into the calendar for you.
