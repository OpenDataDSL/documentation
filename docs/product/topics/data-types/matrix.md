Matrix handling in OpenDataDSL

## What is a matrix?
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, arranged in rows and columns. 
In mathematics, matrices are widely used to represent linear transformations, to solve systems of linear equations, and for many other applications. 
Matrices are often denoted by capital letters and the elements of a matrix are referred to by lowercase letters with subscripts, for example, A_{ij} refers to the element in the i-th row and j-th column of matrix A.

Matrices are typically used to store:
* Correlations
* Covariances
* Options
* Implied Volatilities
