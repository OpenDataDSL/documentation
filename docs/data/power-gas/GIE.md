## Overview

![](/img/data/gie.jpg)

Gas Infrastructure Europe is a representative organization towards the European Institutions (European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union) as well as the European bodies of regulators (ACER, CEER) and other stakeholders.

GIE was formally established on 10 March 2005 as a legally independent and non-profit association with official articles of associations. Its Secretariat is based in Brussels (Avenue de Cortenbergh 100).GIE – Gas Infrastructure Europe – is representing 68 member companies from 27 countries, gathering operators of gas infrastructures across Europe: transmission pipelines, storage facilities and LNG terminals.

Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) is an association representing the interests of European natural gas infrastructure operators active in natural gas transmission, storage and LNG regasification. GIE is a trusted partner of European institutions, regulatory bodies and industry stakeholders. It is based in Brussels, the heart of European policymaking.

Its internal structure has three columns corresponding to the three types of infrastructure activities represented: GTE (Gas Transmission Europe), GSE (Gas Storage Europe) and GLE (Gas LNG Europe), all of which fall under the umbrella of GIE. This structure allows member companies to speak with one voice on infrastructure topics as well as to build positions on column-specific issues.
