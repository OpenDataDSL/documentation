The European Power Exchange

## Overview

![](/img/data/epex.png)

European Power Exchange (EPEX SPOT) SE is a European electric power exchange operating in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

The Paris-based company with offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Bern, Brussels, London and Vienna has been created in 2008 through the merger of the power spot activities of the energy exchanges Powernext SA in France and EEX AG in Germany. In 2015, EPEX SPOT integrated with APX Group. Driving forward the integration of European power markets is the main goal of EPEX SPOT. Our transnational Day-Ahead and Intraday markets are its engine.

EPEX SPOT provides a market place where Exchange members send their orders to buy or sell electricity in determined delivery areas. Our role consists in matching these orders in a transparent manner, according to the public Exchange rules.As an important result of this process, EPEX SPOT broadcasts the prices resulting from the trades.
