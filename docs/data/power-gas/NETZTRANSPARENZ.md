Netztransparenz

![](/img/data/netztransperenz.png)

Netztransparenz is a joint information platform operated by the four German transmission system operators (TSOs). It provides a comprehensive view of the German electricity market, including information on generation, transmission, and consumption, with a focus on transparency and clarity for both professionals and the general public.

They publish the standardized imbalance prices across control areas (reBAP), balancing energy price (AEP) and data points related to the NRV and RZ balance.

The intraday price index ID-AEP takes into account trading transactions in continuous exchange-based electricity trading on the intraday market in the German market area.

The volume-weighted average price is determined from the most recently completed trading transactions of the respective quarter-hour product that exceed a trading volume of 500 MW.

The control area balance (RZ balance) is determined for each TSO from the sum of all measures used to balance the balance. The sum of these represents the network control network balance (NRV balance) for Germany. The balances provide information about the deviation of consumption from production, the absolute value of which the TSOs minimize by using control energy.
