Nord Pool is the power exchange for Nordic and Baltic countries.

Nord Pool AS is a pan-European power exchange. Nord Pool has a main office in Oslo and further offices in Stockholm, Helsinki, Tallinn and London. The company is owned by the European exchange operator Euronext as well as TSO Holding, which represents the continental Nordic and Baltic countries' transmission system operators (TSOs: Fingrid, Energinet, Statnett, Svenska Kraftn√§t, and Litgrid). Nord Pool has two subsidiaries, Nord Pool AB and Nord Pool Finland Oy.

On 27 December 2001, Nord Pool ASA's spot market (derivatives and physical energy markets) activities were spun off into a new company, Nord Pool Spot AS. The remaining parts of Nord Pool ASA were later acquired by Nasdaq, and are presently known as Nasdaq Commodities.
