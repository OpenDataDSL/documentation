TenneT

![](/img/data/tennet.png)

TenneT is a leading European electricity transmission system operator (TSO) with its main activities in the Netherlands and Germany. 
As the Transmission System Operator (TSO) for the Netherlands, and a significant part of Germany, TenneT owns and operates over 25,000 kilometres of high-voltage lines and cables, they deliver electricity to 43 million domestic and business users, safely and reliably, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.

They have sophisticated control systems to keep the grid in balance. This is crucial, because if the demand for electricity exceeds supply, it can lead to a blackout.

To prevent such outages, they play a prominent role in developing cross-border connections and market solutions for distributing electricity in Northwest Europe. As the first truly cross-border TSO, TenneT is one of Europeâ€™s largest investors in national and cross-border transport capacity on land and at sea, bringing together the Northwest European energy markets and driving the energy transition in Europe.
