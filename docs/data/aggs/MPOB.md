The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (Malay: Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia), abbreviated MPOB, is a government agency responsible for the promotion and development of the palm oil industry in Malaysia. It is one of the agencies under Malaysia's Ministry of Primary Industries. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) was established in 1998.The resulting organization was named the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and officially began operations on 1 May 2000.

The MPOB oversees all stages of palm oil production in Malaysia, from planting to exporting. The MPOB supports the development of new products including biodiesel and alternate uses for palm biomass, the organic waste produced when processing oil palm trees. The research into biomass has led to the development of wood and paper products, fertilizers, bioenergy sources, polyethylene sheeting for use in vehicles and other products made of palm biomass.
