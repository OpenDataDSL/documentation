CEPEA
============================================================

Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics

## Overview

![](/img/data/cepea.jpg)

CEPEA is the economic research center at Esalq (“Luiz de Queiroz” College of Agriculture), USP (University of São Paulo), in Piracicaba. The Center develops research regarding economic, financial, social and environmental aspects of about 30 agribusiness supply chains.
CEPEA’s team talks every day to its collaborators: farmers, dealers and agents from inputs and processing industries from all over Brazil. The data obtained from these agents or collaborators are statistically treated and analyzed and then released both to these agents specifically and to the general public. Price data are statistically processed to obtain Indexes and Regional Averages.
