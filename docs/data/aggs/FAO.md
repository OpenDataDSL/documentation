FAO
============================================================

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

## Overview

![](/img/data/fao.jpg)

Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAOSTAT).

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger.
Their goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With 195 members - 194 countries and the European Union, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.

One of FAO’s very first tasks upon its establishment is to prepare a survey to better understand the state of nutrition in the world. The Organization’s first World Food Survey provides a comprehensive picture of the food situation, confirming, through concrete scientific evidence, long-held beliefs that wide-spread hunger and malnourishment are rampant. Although somewhat imprecise by today’s standards, the survey covered 70 countries and was a pioneering attempt to analyse the state of food in the world.
